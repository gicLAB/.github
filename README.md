# gicLAB

The Glasgow Intelligent Computing Laboratory (_gicLAB_ for short), is a research group in the [School of Computing Science](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/) at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/).
We are part of the [Glasgow Systems Section (GLASS)](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/systems-section/#overview), where we focus on research at the intersection of Computing Systems and Machine Learning.
